### This file was created in lieu of a missing/deleted feedback pull request ###

Functionality:
  -Most of the stories have been accounted for, with messages and rooms not displaying properly after creating a new message/room and with messages not posting to the database when they are 'created' through the frontend.
  -Additionally, registration and login works correctly, however both are missing user feedback for incorrect inputs/failure and registration is missing user feedback for correct outcomes.
  Suggestions:
    -In the future, I would ensure that there is user feedback (i.e an alert telling the user when they have successfully logged in)
    -In the future, I would suggest you further test your endpoints, both on the front and backend and make sure that they perform correctly.
    -In the future, I would suggest you test your frontend functionality further to ensure that there are no errors or unexpected results
  Icebox: There is a room creation function, however there is no admin/user edit and deletion privilege. As such, I cannot award the bonus point
### Overall Score: 2/3 ###

Readability:
  -Some files have really strong commenting, while others have NO commenting. Variables and functions are well named and are easy to understand
  Suggestions:
    -In the future, make sure to add more commenting about what each item within a return is doing and perhaps what functions it utilizes
### Overall Score: 2/3 ###

Organization:
  -Your files are well named, however your structure is a little all over the place, with some components being kept in a Pages folder and others being kept in a Components folder (additionally some files are .js and some are .jsx). Within your files, code is well organized and easy to understand
  Suggestions:
    -In the future, I would suggest keeping all of your components in one, central folder and that ALL your files follow the same file type standard, unless there is a reason to have different files.
### Overall Score: 2/3 ###

### FINAL SCORE: 6/9 ###
